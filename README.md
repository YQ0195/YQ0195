## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about software development and always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects. Here's a bit more about me and what I'm currently up to:

- ðŸ”­ Projects I have worked on:
  - An **Android Kotlin app** with **Stripe integration** for secure payment processing.
  - A **Node.js backend** that integrates with **Stripe API** and connects to a **MySQL database** for transaction and user data management.
  - A **Web3 app** that runs locally using **Hardhat** and connects to **MetaMask** to simulate the transfer of ETH with a **React frontend**.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Advanced **Kotlin** techniques and Android best practices.
  - How to develop backend applications using **Golang**.
  - Deeper insights into **blockchain development** and **Web3 technologies**.
  - **Database optimization** and **API design** strategies.
 
- âš¡ Aspirations:
  - I would love to be part of a big project and work for a company whose products I use on a daily basis. It has always been a dream of mine to contribute to something that I personally value and rely on. 
  - I truly enjoy working on projects where I can develop a deep sense of ownership, taking pride in my contributions and being invested in the success of the product. This drives me to deliver my best work and continuously seek ways to improve and innovate.
